This repository contains the official source code and dataset for the research paper **"The builder-worker paradox: A mixed-methods analysis of affective dissonance in agentic AI discourse"**, submitted to *Royal Society Open Science*.

## 📄 Abstract
This study investigates the divergence in public discourse regarding "Agentic AI." By analyzing **19,250 Reddit posts** from late 2024 to late 2025, we identify a "Builder-Worker Paradox," where technical practitioners exhibit neutral frustration regarding operational friction, while the general workforce exhibits high levels of existential anxiety. The study employs a mixed-methods approach combining **BERTopic** modeling, **GoEmotions** affective analysis (RoBERTa), and qualitative coding.
